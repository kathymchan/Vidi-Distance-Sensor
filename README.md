# Vidi-Distance-Sensor
The Vidi Distance Sensor is a device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles above the waist. When the sensor detects an obstacle, the user will know through a vibrating strip they will feel on their chest; the vibrations will be stronger when an obstacle is closer.

The device is made up of an Arduino Nano, a LiDar sensor, a vibration motor and a battery pack put together with wires and soldering, attached to a 3x7 prototype board, contained in a 108mm long, 37mm wide and approximately 26mm deep 3D printed box held to the chest by nylon straps and velcro. The deviceâ€™s distance sensor is detected in a cone shape, with the smallest point being the sensor and widening as it extends out. If it detects two surfaces at different distances, the sensor will prioritize the closer object or if the two distances are close to one another the distance will be the average of both distances. 

Our device is meant to be used in tandem with already existing technology made for those with sight impairments. The most widely used mobility and sight aid is the white cane, made to be moved around to scan for objects at ground level. Our device is ideally meant to be used with a white cane. The wearer will increase awareness of their surroundings by using the device to reveal obstacles above ground-level, while the cane can help with cracks and objects lower to the ground.
